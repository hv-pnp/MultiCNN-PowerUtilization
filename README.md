# MultiCNN-PowerUtilization
This repository contains the implementation of a multiclass Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for power utilization prediction and visualization in next-generation System-on-Chips (SoCs). The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately predict and visualize the power consumption of SoCs based on various workload parameters. The CNN architecture is designed to handle multiclass classification, allowing the model to categorize power utilization into different classes. By leveraging the power of CNNs, this model aims to provide insights into power consumption patterns and enable better resource management in SoCs. The repository includes the source code, and detailed instructions on how to train and evaluate the model.
